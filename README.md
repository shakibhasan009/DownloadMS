This AutoIt code defines a function called DownloadMS that automates the process of downloading Appx and MSIX packages from the Microsoft Store. It takes the product ID as input and uses the rg-adguard.net API to retrieve the download links. The code then filters the links based on the user's OS architecture to download the appropriate package, excluding unnecessary files like .BlockMap or those intended for different architectures (ARM, x64 if on x86). The downloaded files are saved in a temporary folder named after the product ID. Finally, the code demonstrates the usage of the function with two examples, downloading OneNote for Windows 10 and Angry Birds Friends.
